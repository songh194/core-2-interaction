            <h3>Interview by Miranda Sawyer</h2>
            <h1>Martin McDonagh: ‘No one really tries to make sad films any more’</h1>
            <h4>The London Irish writer-director on his bad early plays, enjoying a quiet home life with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and his latest film – a friendship breakup movie starring In Bruges’ Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson</h4>
            <p>Martin McDonagh, writer, director and creator of small, crazed worlds of fierce people taking their pain out on each other, is talking about his new film, The Banshees of Inisherin. “It’s a really beautiful film, with brilliant performances,” he says. “And it’s funny… but it’s sad. No one really tries to make sad films any more.”</p>
            <p>It is sad, The Banshees of Inisherin, but, as he says, it’s also very funny; plus grotesque, violent, tender, surprising, a bit spooky and visually stunning. Many of these elements are established components of a McDonagh creation, whether his early plays, such as The Cripple of Inishmaan (1997), or his 2017 gothic revenge western Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which won Oscars for Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. The Banshees of Inisherin, though, is a shift in mood. Less speedy, more painful and mythical. Like a terrible fable.</p>
            <p>As you might have guessed by the title, it’s also Irish. Though far from the usual cliched depiction, its opening shots, across the knobbly pastel land and out to the glittering sea, could be filmed nowhere else. It was made in eight weeks in the summer of 2021 on Inishmore and Achill, two islands off Ireland’s west coast. The weather was wonderful and the sunsets astounding. “The most beautiful summer I’ve ever experienced in Ireland. Which was,” says McDonagh, “unexpected.”</p>
            <p>Though he was born and grew up in London, McDonagh’s parents live just outside Galway, on the road to the coast where Inishmore sits with the other two Aran Islands. He’s at his folks’ house now, Zooming from the sofa in his shorts, and shows me the view; yep, it’s lovely. During filming, he would stay here at weekends. “Though I didn’t tell my parents what I’d been up to,” he says. “I’ve learned not to, because it usually ends up in some gross beheading or something.”</p>
            <p>In McDonagh’s plays and films there is often something gross, someone’s guts being spilled, or a gun fired flamboyantly in an enclosed place, or an animal being hurt and setting off something terrifying in humans. In The Banshees of Inisherin, alongside a tight tale of male friendship is a highly specific, progressive act of violence so appalling that it makes you laugh as you flinch away. It’s to do with a hand. Hands having a tough time of it feature in two of McDonagh’s plays – The Beauty Queen of Leenane and A Behanding in Spokane. I ask about this hand thing; he is bamboozled at my connection. “I’ve never made the link,” he insists. “I wouldn’t say it’s psychologically important!” But after I’ve asked, throughout our interview we wave at each other for laughs. This is very McDonagh.</p>
            <p>Back to the sadness, though. The Banshees of Inisherin has much sorrow in it, mostly for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/colin-farrell">Colin Farrell</a>, who pays Pádraic, a nice bloke who is sad for the whole of the film. His distress is directly caused by Colm, his best friend. Every day, Pádraic calls round for Colm to go to the pub. One day, Colm doesn’t come. He tells Pádraic, with harsh simplicity: “I don’t like you no more” – and it’s this declaration that fires the starting gun for the turmoil that follows.</p>
            <p>McDonagh, who won best screenplay at the recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/10/venice-film-festival-2022-week-two-roundup-blonde-the-banshees-of-inisherin-the-whale-saint-omer-don-t-worry-darlng-bardo-master-gardener-eternal-daughter">Venice film festival</a> for The Banshees of Inisherin, says he tried to imbue the friends’ breakup “with all of the sadness of the breakup of a love relationship… because I think we’ve all been both parties in that equation,” he says. “And there’s something horrible about both sides. Like knowing you have to break up with someone is a horrible, horrible thing as well. I’m not sure which is the best place to be in.”</p>
            <p>You surely wouldn’t want to be Pádraic, though. His face, when he first gets the “you’re dumped” news from Colm, is a picture of devastation. “Yeah, it takes him almost 30 seconds to understand,” says McDonagh, “and you can see him going through the process – is this true? And then: this is true – and it’s all in his face, in about 20, 30 seconds. It’s my favourite bit in the whole film. It’s heartbreaking.”</p>

            <br>
            <p>Farrell won best actor at Venice for his performance – his eyebrows alone deserve an award, so expressive are they – but everyone in the film is great. Kerry Condon is Pádraic’s sister, Siobhan; Barry Keoghan is Dominic, a sharp lad deemed stupid by all around him; and no-longer-friend Colm is played, with shattering heft and tenderness, by Brendan Gleeson. McDonagh fans will be happy about the pairing: Farrell and Gleeson first acted together in In Bruges, McDonagh’s much-loved first full-length feature, and the pair’s chemistry is genuine. In Bruges, a funny, brutal, post-1990s tale of out-of-their-element hitmen, didn’t cause huge waves when it was released in 2008, but has achieved cult status since. “People discovered it in the intervening years and they’ve taken it to their hearts,” says McDonagh. “Especially blokes. They come up and say: ‘We really love In Bruges.’ Almost as if they’ve made it themselves.”</p>
            <p>In In Bruges there’s a definite status hierarchy between the two leads – Gleeson higher, Farrell lower – and this leads to shifting sympathies and resentments. And in The Banshees of Inisherin, which has a similar status setup, McDonagh found himself changing allegiance. When he wrote the screenplay, he had sympathy for Pádraic, the dumped friend, “because he’s a nice guy”. But, he says: “I knew for the film to work, I had to give Colm’s side of the equation as much merit and as much thought. So Brendan and I talked about Colm’s music, and the desire for art, and with that, for me, from being 60-40 in favour of Pádraic I moved to 49-51.”</p>
            <p>Colm’s side is this: he has to end his friendship with Pádraic because time is moving on. Colm’s a musician; he’s getting older and he wants to use the rest of his days creatively, rather than sitting in the pub with Pádraic talking nonsense. So he decides to dump his friend in, it has to be said, a harsh manner. Which raises several questions, including: do you have to be selfish and cruel in order to create? Can an artist be nice?</p>
            <p>Well, with the film it’s one of the things, hopefully, to be discussed. But I don’t subscribe to the whole tortured artist thing,” says McDonagh. “You hear stories about film directors who are total cunts. And they usually make shit films. None of my cinematic heroes are really nasty. Maybe Sam Peckinpah. He was a very tough guy, and you see that in his films, but that’s OK, because he tortured himself as much as anyone. But I don’t see the value in being a dickhead.”</p>
            <p>However, when it comes to the “time’s running out, let’s crack on with making stuff” realisation, McDonagh is very much on Colm’s side. The writer-director is 52 now, and recently made the decision that he’s going to spend what creative time he has left – he reckons “around 25 years” – making films rather than plays. His reasoning? Films are quicker.</p>
            <p>“I always used to think they took longer than plays, but with this one we were filming it a year ago, and now it’s out,” he says. “But if you’re lucky enough to have successful plays, which I have been, then they start off-West End, like at the Royal Court, then you go to the West End, then to off-Broadway, and then to on Broadway. And to get that right with each move, to cast it and take care of it, go to rehearsals, that’s five years of your life.”</p>
