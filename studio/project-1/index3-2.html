        <div>You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a <a href="comma.html" target="_blank">comma</a>, a <a href="colon.html" target="_blank">colon</a> or a <a href="semicolon.html" target="_blank">semi-colon</a>.</div>
        <br>
        <div>There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons you can think of them as
             commas and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as periods and then using 
             them can make you feel adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I 
             myself never have, I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma and commas are servile they 
             have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there 
             just for practical purposes. Semi-colons and colons had for me from the first completely this 
             character the character that a comma has and not the character that a period has and therefore
             and definitely I have never used them. But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might 
             well possibly they might have in them something of the character of the period and so it might 
             have been an adventure to use them. I really do not think so. I think however lively they are 
             or disguised they are they are definitely more comma than period and so really I cannot regret
              not having used them. They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a comma but 
              they are a comma all the same. They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally 
              within them the comma nature. And now what does a comma do and what has it to do and why do I 
              feel as I do about them.</div><br>
