        <div>When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me. I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing.Â

        <div>Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always liked dependent adverbial clauses. 
            I have like dependent adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence and independence. 
            You can see how loving the intensity of complication of these things that commas would be degrading<a href="index4-1.html">.</a> 
            Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive complication would you want any artificial aid to bring about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about the comma as I did and as I do.
