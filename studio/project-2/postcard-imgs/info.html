                Dear visitor, 
                <br>
                So... I collect postcards. And I rarely use them (the answer is never). A few lucky postcards would go on my wall but most of them are just always in my postcard box in the drawer, except for the times I occasionally take them out and look at them and be happy. My collection started just few years ago from galleries and places I visit. They remind me of the memories attached to them and I don’t write letters or anything like that. The time has changed and people don’t really write a lot of letters now do they. So here is my unused postcard collection. Maybe you could use them for me. ☺
                <br>
                Cheers, Hannah
